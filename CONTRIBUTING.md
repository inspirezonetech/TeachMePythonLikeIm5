Run flake8 on your python file before submitting.

The following flake8 errors can be excluded 
- `E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1`
- `expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found 1 flake8(E305)`
- `line too long (x > x characters) flake8(E501)`

How to run flake8 using command line:

# runs flake8 and ignores the 3 errors
flake8 path/to/code/to/check.py --ignore E302,E305,E501
