# Here we will look into how to use one of the loops - while loop to generate desired outputs with certain condition

# Syntax: After while we pass the condition to be checked

t = 0
while t < 10:
 t = t + 2
 print(t)

# Also we can use an |else| stance with the while loop as if the condition don't satisfy and we need a last statement to be executed after the while loop is finished:

t = 0
while t < 10:
 t = t + 2
 print(t)
else:
 print("loop finished")

# So above loop will work till the specified condition is satisfied hence will run about 5 times in this case

# Code here explaining concept with comments to guide

# Now as we have learnt about while loops
# We can try and do a challenge for some fun then
# Reverse the Number:
# What we need to do is take n as input and print the reversed n.
# Example:
# Input - 2345
# Output - 5432
