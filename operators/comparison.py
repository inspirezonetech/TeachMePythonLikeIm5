# Comparision Operators in Python
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# So basically there are 6 Comparison Operators in Python , let us learn them one by one .
# Note : One more thing to note is that whenever you compare two "things" , the return value of this Comparision will be either True or False

# 1. "=="(Equal) -> we use this operator to see if two variables are equal.
a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b)  # Here since a and b are equal we will get True in output.

# 2. "!="(Not Equal) -> we use this operator to see if two variables are equal or not , if they are not equal it will return True else False.
a = 5
b = 5
print(a != b)  # Here since a and b are equal we will get False in  output.

# 3. ">"(Greater than ) -> we use this operator to see if one variable is greater than other.
a = 9
b = 5
print(a > b)  # Here since a is greater than b ,  we will get True in output.

# 4. ">="(Greater than or equal to ) -> we use this operator to see if two variables are equal or one is grater than the other.
a = 5
b = 5
print(a >= b)  # Here since a and b are equal,  we will get True in output.

# 5. "<"(Less than ) -> we use this operator to see if one variable is less than other.
a = 9
b = 5
print(a < b)  # Here since a is greater than b ,  we will get False in  output.

# 6. "<="(Less than or equal to ) -> we use this operator to see if two variables are equal or one is less than the other.
a = 3
b = 5
print(a <= b)  # Here since a is less than b ,  we will get True in output.

# Challenge for you :
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Given a array of numbers .

# Traverse the array and print following :
# If the number is less than 10 - print "The number is smaller than 10."
# If the number is greater than 10 - print "The number is greater than 10."
# If the number is equal t0 10 - print "The number is equal to 10."
# The array nums is given below .
nums = [1, 3, 10, -7, 8]
# write your code here
